# Kaggle-DigitRecognizer
A kaggle problem where we have to recognise handwritten digits using Deep learning.

The goal is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is.
For every ImageId in the test set, you should predict the correct label.

## Models Used are:

1. Feed Fowward Network
2. Convolutional Neural Network
3. CNN with Data Augumentation
